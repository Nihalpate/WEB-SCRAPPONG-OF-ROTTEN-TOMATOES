# Rottan Tomatos Web Scrapper

## Introduction
This repository is for the Rotten Tomatoes Web Scrapper that I have worked on during my academics. The web scrapper will scrape Rotten Tomatoes site and provide us movie reviews. The user need to enter the link of the movie review site and the page limit (how many page user want to scrap), the scraper will scrape all the pages and display top 10 reviews.  

## Fetures 
The Python code also perform sentiment analysis, meaning the code will detect the sentiment of the comment whether the comment is positive or negative with help of VEDAR SENTIMENT ANALYSER a ML library in Python.

## Future Improvements
My future improvement for this project to extend at the level at which code will only take "Movie Name" as input, instead of the whole link of the page.
